# Microphone-Based Stealth Mechanism in Unity - README

Welcome to the tutorial on creating a microphone-based stealth mechanism in Unity! This project demonstrates how to integrate real-time audio input from a player's microphone into a stealth game, allowing AI enemies to react to sound dynamically. Perfect for aspiring game developers and enthusiasts, this tutorial covers the essentials of implementing audio-based AI detection in a Unity 3D environment.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial guides you through creating a stealth game mechanism where the player's noise, captured via a microphone, influences the behavior of AI enemies. The enemies can detect the player's sounds, enhancing the stealth experience and adding an innovative, interactive element to the gameplay.
